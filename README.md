### problems

Now this problem has been solved at st3-1.6.0.

~~Because almost every package has a `Main.sublime-menu`, So some package name maybe override the Default one.~~

~~AFAIK, minimal manual delete including~~:

+ **SublimeREPL** delete caption

+ **Minify** Overwrite, but delete

+ **Tag** delete mnemonic caption

+ **Indent XML** delete caption Selection

+ **HTMLBeautify** delete caption Edit

+ **GraphvizPreview** delete caption Edit
